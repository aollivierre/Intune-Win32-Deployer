## Dependencies
With the current version of the IntuneWin32App (v1.4.2), setting a dependency is not possible. 
However, the dependend program is uploaded to Intune. 
The workaround is to set the dependency yourself. 

The Error you will get cuase of this is: 
    Publish-IWDWin32App : Error adding dependency for XXX
    A parameter cannot be found that matches parameter name 'eq'.
